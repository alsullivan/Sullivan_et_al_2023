Raw data files, and complete Rscript for the paper "Invasion by the annual grass, Ventenata dubia does not impact mycorrhizal fungal abundance in an endangered prairie" by Sullivan et al. 2023, Restoration Ecology September 2023
Sullivan, A.A., Bunn, R. and Cheeke, T.E. (2023), Invasion by the annual grass, Ventenata dubia does not impact mycorrhizal fungal abundance in an endangered prairie. Restor Ecol e14008. https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.14008

The purpose of this repository is to give the public access to data files used for analysis as a part of this project and to provide the R code used for the analysis of each dataset. This data can be used for practice, meta-analysis, or literature reviews. 

I wanted to share our data and script as open-access for multiple reasons. 
  1. We used common community ecology, and mycorrhizal fungi analysis to analyze our plant community data, mycorrhizal abundance, and soil characteristics. If I had access to something like this in grad school to follow along to, it might have been slightly easier to write my code. I hope this helps anyone currently undergoing analysis.
  2. The data we found on the effects of an invasive annual grass on mycorrhizal fungi and native plant species is useful and can be used in future research.
  3. If anyone has any questions about our data or code while reading the paper, they can view it here themselves.

It is likely that no updates to this script or data will be made in the future, as the paper was published on September 6, 2023 and I am no longer working on this project.
